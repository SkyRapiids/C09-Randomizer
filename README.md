# C09-Randomizer

Disclaimer: I am not in any way affiliated with SBN3, Wrath Club, or anyone else involved in the Class of '09 series. This project contains no code or assets from the games, and requires the user to own them in order to function.

An app which randomizes elements from the Class of '09 games by SBN3 and Wrath Club to create a near infinite number of possibilities. Currently contains the ability to randomize these elements of The Re-Up only: Character sprites, and background sprites. Cross game functionality, voiceline, scene, and choice randomization is also planned for the future, along with many features mentioned in the app.

This currently only supports the Re-Up because i wrote this code in like 3 days, and cross-game stuff is too complicated for 3 days. The ability to randomize the other two games will come later, and after that I plan to add the ability to randomize the games together.

Please feel free to suggest features or report bugs in the github page for this!
