# C09-Randomizer

DISCLAIMER: I am not in any way affiliated with SBN3, Wrath Club, or anyone else involved in the Class of '09 series. This project contains no code or assets from the games, and requires the user to own them in order to function. Additionally, please be aware that files critical for the games' functions will be modified by this program. There is functionality to restore these files in the app. However, if this for some reason does not work, I am not responsible for the damage of your copy of any Class of '09. 

If for some reason you cannot restore randomized files, make a copy of the "saves" folder inside of "game", in the directory of the affected game. Then, uninstall the game, reinstall it, and replace the saves folder in the reinstalled game's files with the copy you made.

An app which randomizes elements from the Class of '09 games by SBN3 and Wrath Club to create a near infinite number of possibilities. Currently contains the ability to randomize these elements of The Re-Up only: Character sprites, and background sprites. Cross game functionality, voiceline, scene, and choice randomization is also planned for the future, along with many features mentioned in the app.

This currently only supports the Re-Up because i wrote this code in like 3 days, and cross-game stuff is too complicated for 3 days. The ability to randomize the other two games will come later, and after that I plan to add the ability to randomize the games together.

Please feel free to suggest features or report bugs in the github page for this!
